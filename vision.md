## Introduction

In modern organizations, employee independence has increased significantly. It is now common for workers to divide their time across multiple projects and report to several managers. As a result, managers have fewer informal interactions with their team members and find it increasingly difficult to monitor and manage vacation schedules effectively.

This lack of centralized visibility often leads to overlapping absences, manual tracking errors, and administrative delays. The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) is intended to address these challenges by providing a unified digital platform for managing employee leave efficiently and transparently.

## Vision Statement

The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) will empower employees to manage their own vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off without needing detailed knowledge of company or facility policies. It will streamline HR operations, reduce non-core administrative tasks for managers, and foster a greater sense of autonomy and transparency across the organization.


##Business Goals

Automate the vacation request process to replace the existing manual approach.
Accelerate approval workflows to reduce processing time from several days to near real-time.
Simplify the process for employees to submit vacation requests, including urgent cases.
Ensure reliability by preventing loss or mismanagement of submitted requests.
Provide visibility for employees into their time-off history and upcoming leave plans.
Enable managers to easily view team availability and plan resource allocation.
Reduce operational costs and increase HR department efficiency through automation and digital record-keeping.

##Scope

The Vacation Tracking System (VTS) will focus on automating and streamlining the vacation and leave management process within the organization. The system aims to provide web-based access for employees and managers to handle vacation requests, approvals, and tracking efficiently.

##In Scope

Develop a web-based application accessible through standard browsers.
Integrate with existing legacy and HR systems to retrieve employee information and update leave balances.
Provide functionality for employees to request vacation, sick leave, and personal time off.
Enable managers to review, approve, or reject vacation requests.
Maintain leave history and provide visibility of team availability.

##Out of Scope

Development of a mobile application.
Automatic leave approval or decision-making using AI or predictive logic.
Payroll management and other HR functions not directly related to leave tracking.
